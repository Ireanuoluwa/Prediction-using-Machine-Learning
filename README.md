## Mobile Price and Milk Quality Prediction
This repository focuses on two prediction projects: Mobile Price Prediction and Milk Quality Prediction.

Mobile Price Prediction
The Mobile Price Prediction project aims to predict the price of mobile phones using parameters such as resolution, brand, size, weight, imaging quality, RAM, battery, and CPU power. Various machine learning algorithms can be employed for this task, and the dataset used contains mobile phone specifications and corresponding prices.

Milk Quality Prediction
The Milk Quality Prediction project focuses on classifying milk grades based on properties such as temperature, taste, pH, turbidity, odor, and fat content. Classification models are developed to categorize milk samples into different grades. The dataset used contains milk properties and corresponding grades.

Both projects involve steps such as dataset preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and prediction. Future improvements for each project include feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, and potential web application development.

By combining these projects, this repository offers insights into price prediction for mobile phones and quality classification for milk samples, showcasing the application of machine learning techniques in these domains.
